This is a library for interfacing with serial ports written in C++. Under the hood the termios library is used,
so the library should compile without problems on any POSIX-compliant system.

    Modern C++.
    RAII compliant.
    No dependencies.
    Only two files (libserial.h and libserial.cpp).

The library has been tested on Linux and used in a number of embedded systems.
